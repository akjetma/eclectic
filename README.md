keeping track of reference material in case i'd like to look at it again later:
## references:
- physics: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier
- character controller: https://github.com/pmndrs/ecctrl
- basic three js impl of an fps game: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/games_fps.html
- Dust2.jsx was generated by this tool, then hand-tweaked: https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx
- Dust2 map can be extracted from the game files, or you can google for it
- Mimicked this to create collision geometry out of the dust2 mesh: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier/blob/main/demo/src/examples/plinko/Plinko.tsx


## log
- think i'm just going to copy the build folder over to my github pages repo for now... 
  i don't want to have build artifacts in the source repo, especially not at the root of project,
  which gh-pages requires, i believe. another thing to look into later
