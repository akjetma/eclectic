## log
- think i'm just going to copy the build folder over to my github pages repo for now... i don't want to have build artifacts in the source repo, especially not at the root of project, which gh-pages requires, i believe. another thing to look into later
- found a collection of old custom hl/quake maps on the internet archive.. i then found a tool that might be able to convert the bsp files into gltf (which i could then convert to fiber components), but it fails to build bc the author targeted linux and windows only. some of the "ifdef linux" tests were overly strict (mac would work fine) so i tried commenting a few out buuut yea i did that like 3 times and i think it's probably better to just get a vm going to run the software to build the maps to etc. etc... i bet those maps are pretty cool though, it'll be worth it
- found a python package that could convert to bsp to obj. seem's like it would've worked, but the archive i found doesn't have the necessary associated .lmp file for each .bmp file, so the whole thing's a bust
